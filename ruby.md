# Ruby on Rails

Uses MVC pattern:

- Models: interact with database, receive updates, notify controller of changes
- Controller: passes info from view to model
- View: front-end for user, can be updated and pass actions to controller

*Convention over Configuration.* You don't need to make decisions.  
*DRY.* Don't Repeat Yourself.

## Structure

App folder has all of MVC.
